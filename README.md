### Talk to it like this

```
> Every weekday at 9am, send me a daily brief with weather,
  calendar, urgent email, and overdue tasks.

> Remember that I prefer concise answers and daily updates in Telegram.

> Watch my inbox for urgent client messages and alert me if I do not reply.

> Draft a reply to this message and ask before sending it.

> Build me a landing page for my new project. Deploy it with a public URL.

> Search the web for recent papers on multi-agent architectures,
  summarize the top 3, and save them to my documents.
```

It does not stop at a reply. It can **save the preference**, **schedule the follow-up**, **deliver the brief**, **draft the reply**, **watch for updates**, or **promote the work into a durable task** and come back later.

## What Is AgentArk?

AgentArk is a self-hosted personal AI assistant for daily life and work.

It runs on your machine, keeps track of your preferences, delivers a daily brief, follows up across channels, and can take action safely when you ask. When you need more than a chat app, it can schedule routines, monitor things in the background, build apps, and run deeper self-improving automations.

It is built to evolve with you. Accepted work, user corrections, repeated routines, and live tool outcomes are reflected into local memory, prompts, routing, and strategy so the assistant gets more aligned with your workflow instead of acting like every session is day one.

- If you keep rewriting replies to be shorter, it learns to stay concise by default
- If a certain tool path keeps succeeding for a task, it becomes more likely to choose that path again
- If you correct how it briefs, routes, or follows up, future runs reflect that correction

Your data stays with you. Your secrets are encrypted. You keep the final say on risky actions.

## Install

### Quick start (Docker Compose)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentark-ai/AgentArk.git && cd AgentArk
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8990**, pick your LLM provider in Settings, start chatting.

### Convenience installer

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentark-ai/AgentArk/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Review the script before piping to a shell. For the strongest verification story, use Docker Compose or a pinned GHCR image.

### Published container image

| Image | Includes | Size (linux/amd64) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `ghcr.io/agentark-ai/agentark:latest` | Full runtime with Playwright, cloudflared, tailscale, WhatsApp bridge | ~4.5 GB |

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/agentark-ai/agentark:latest    # moving tag
docker pull ghcr.io/agentark-ai/agentark:1.2.3     # pinned version
```

For production or first-time installs, prefer a pinned version tag and verify the attestation first. See [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md).

### CLI mode

Talk to your agent directly from the terminal:

```bash
agentark chat                    # start chatting
agentark setup                   # guided CLI setup wizard
agentark pulse                   # run ArkPulse health check
```

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           AgentArk v0.1.0 - CLI Chat                    ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Type your message and press Enter.                      ║
║  Commands: /exit  /new  /help                            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

you ➜ what can you do?
agentark ➜ I can help with...
```

| Action | How |
|:--|:--|
| Chat with the agent | Just type your message |
| Run ArkPulse health check | `run arkpulse` or `check system health` |
| Deploy & manage apps | `deploy a weather dashboard` |
| Search the web | `search for latest AI news` |
| Manage tasks & goals | `show my tasks` |
| Toggle full trace mode | `Ctrl+T` |
| Autocomplete slash commands | `Tab` |
| Exit | `Ctrl+D` or `/exit` |

All capabilities available in the Web UI work in CLI mode - same tools, memory, and integrations.

### Build from source

```bash
# Rust 1.75+
export AGENTARK_DATABASE_URL=postgres://agentark:agentark@localhost:5432/agentark
cargo build --release
./target/release/agentark --headless
```

### Verify before install

1. Verify the release checksum against `SHA256SUMS`
2. Verify the Sigstore keyless signature
3. Verify the GitHub provenance attestation
4. Review [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Remote access

Built-in remote access is toggleable from Settings. Cloudflare Quick Tunnel is the default public-link mode (no ports to open, traffic encrypted). For private end-to-end encrypted access, choose Tailscale from Settings.

### Management

```bash
docker compose up -d                            # start
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d     # update to latest
docker compose down                             # stop
docker compose down -v                          # stop and full reset
docker compose logs -f agentark-control         # follow logs
```

## How It Stacks Up

### Compared with other self-hosted agents

| Compared with | Strongest at | Where AgentArk is different |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **OpenClaw** | Fast local execution and lightweight setup | AgentArk adds daily-assistant continuity, durable memory, guarded actions, and adaptation from use |
| **PicoClaw** | Small-footprint runtime and low-overhead operation | AgentArk adds multi-channel workflows, deeper automation, richer memory, and adaptive improvement |
| **NanoClaw** | Minimal local operation and simplicity | AgentArk adds background routines, stronger follow-up, broader task execution, and compounding personalization |
| **Agent Zero** | Open-ended autonomy and experimentation | AgentArk adds a stronger trust layer, personal-assistant UX, and a more opinionated adaptation control plane |

In short: choose OpenClaw for a lightweight runtime, PicoClaw for the smallest footprint, NanoClaw for simplicity, Agent Zero for open-ended autonomy, or **AgentArk if you want one self-hosted agent that can chat, automate, remember, follow up, and improve over time**.

### Performance snapshot

|                    | AgentArk   | OpenClaw       | PicoClaw    | NanoClaw      |
|:-------------------|:-----------|:---------------|:------------|:--------------|
| **Cold start**     | **48ms**   | ~800ms         | <1s         | ~500ms        |
| **Idle RAM**       | **34MB**   | ~80MB          | <10MB       | ~60MB         |
| **Binary**         | 38MB       | npm package    | ~12MB       | npm package   |
| **Language**       | Rust       | TypeScript     | Go          | TypeScript    |
| **Memory system**  | 3-tier     | Session-based  | JSONL basic | SQLite basic  |
| **WASM sandbox**   | Yes        | No             | No          | Container     |
| **Self-evolution** | Yes        | No             | No          | No            |

> AgentArk is heavier than minimal agents because it bundles a full web UI, WASM sandbox, Playwright browser automation, and a 3-tier memory system. The others are lighter because they do less.

### Monthly cost comparison

All platforms are free/open-source - the real cost is **AI tokens + hosting**.

|                    | OpenClaw      | PicoClaw                | **AgentArk**           |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Software           | Free          | Free (or $30/mo hosted) | Free                   |
| Avg personal use   | $5 - $50/mo   | $10 - $40/mo            | **$2 - $10/mo**        |
| Avg small team     | $20 - $80/mo  | $30 - $70/mo            | **$10 - $30/mo**       |
| Heavy automation   | $50 - $150/mo | $50 - $120/mo           | **$20 - $50/mo**       |
| Risk of bill shock | Medium        | Medium                  | **Low (cheap models)** |

AgentArk's edge: route to DeepSeek, GLM, Mistral, or local Ollama for $0.10-$0.50/1M tokens vs $3-$15/1M on premium models, while still getting verifiable execution, sandboxing, and approval gates.

## Configuration

### First-time setup

**Web UI:**
1. Open **http://localhost:8990**
2. Go to **Settings** → pick your **LLM Provider** → enter credentials
3. Set **Bot Name** and **Personality** → Save → start chatting

**CLI:**
1. Run `agentark setup` → pick your model/provider
2. Run `agentark chat`

### LLM providers

| Provider | Base URL | Example models |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Ollama** (local) | `http://localhost:11434` | `llama3.2`, `qwen2.5`, `mistral` |
| **OpenRouter** | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `glm-4`, `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` |
| **Anthropic** | built-in | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| **OpenAI** | built-in | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo` |
| **Hugging Face Inference** | `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/v1` | `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | your URL | any compatible model |

### Telegram bot (optional)

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Enable Telegram in Settings, paste the token
3. Add your user ID to Allowed Users (get it from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
4. Save → Restart Bot

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `AGENTARK_CONFIG` | `/app/config` | Configuration directory |
| `AGENTARK_DATA` | `/app/data` | Data directory |
| `AGENTARK_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:8990` | HTTP bind address |
| `AGENTARK_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `AGENTARK_DATABASE_URL` | _(set by Compose)_ | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |

### Default stack notes

- Docker Compose starts Postgres and all internal services automatically
- Local embeddings use `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` by default; external OpenAI-compatible endpoints supported
- User-installed skills live under `/app/data`; app/runtime data stays under Docker volumes
- Keep Docker volumes attached when updating - `docker compose down -v` is a full reset

---

## Security

AES-256-GCM encryption at rest. Argon2id key derivation in master-password mode. Approval-gated actions. WASM sandboxing. Verifiable execution history.

AgentArk stores API keys, OAuth tokens, and custom secrets in encrypted `settings:*` KV records. Memory content, integration credentials, and secret-backed placeholders all use the same encrypted storage path. Secrets are resolved at execution time and never appear in LLM-visible tool-call arguments or traces.

| Layer | Properties |
|:--|:--|
| **Data at rest** | AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation |
| **Data in transit** | HTTPS/TLS when configured, or behind a reverse proxy |
| **Runtime isolation** | Sandboxing, approvals, guarded actions, execution history |
| **Auditability** | Execution proofs, security logs, approval records |

### Permission disclosures

- The default Docker stack mounts your selected workspace into AgentArk containers
- The executor service mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` (host-equivalent Docker control)
- The published image includes browser automation, tunnel tooling, and Docker CLI access
- Public exposure, remote tunnels, and broad workspace mounts increase risk

## Design Principles

- **Secure first** - encrypted secrets, approvals, sandboxing, and verifiable records
- **Daily by default** - briefs, reminders, follow-up, and messaging delivery are first-class
- **Memory that compounds** - each useful interaction builds on previous preferences and facts
- **Self-evolving** - corrections, tool outcomes, and benchmarks improve local memory, prompts, and routing
- **Chat-first** - talk to it naturally, not through config files or flowcharts
- **Power when needed** - tasks, watchers, apps, integrations, and swarm agents for deeper work
- **Model-agnostic** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Self-hosted** - your hardware, your data, your rules

---

## Why Rust?

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Performance** | Tokio async runtime, `Arc<RwLock<T>>` concurrency - no GIL bottleneck |
| **Security** | `Zeroizing` auto-clears secrets from memory; zero `unsafe` blocks in the codebase |
| **Type Safety** | Enums, traits, and compile-time guarantees catch bugs before production |
| **Single Binary** | One compiled binary + Docker - no dependency hell |
| **WASM Sandboxing** | Wasmtime integration is natural in Rust |

## API

Full interactive API docs available at **http://localhost:8990/docs#/** after starting AgentArk.

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Settings won't save</summary>

- Check that you have a valid API key for non-Ollama providers
- Ensure the model name is correct
</details>

<details>
<summary>Telegram bot not responding</summary>

- Restart after changing Telegram settings
- Verify your user ID is in Allowed Users
- Check bot token is correct
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data lost after restart</summary>

- Always use Docker volumes - `docker compose` handles this automatically
- If using `docker run`, add `-v agentark-data:/app/data -v agentark-config:/app/config`
</details>

<details>
<summary>Debug logging</summary>

```bash
AGENTARK_DEBUG=true docker compose up        # full debug
RUST_LOG=info,agentark=debug docker compose up   # agent internals only
```
</details>

---

## Roadmap

- Support multiple accounts per provider across integrations, channels, and reasoning, with project-scoped account management and selection.
- Let users refine an active chat run with extra instructions while AgentArk is still working.

### Guidelines

- **PRs over issues** - code speaks louder than feature requests
- **One concern per PR** - keep changes focused and reviewable
- **Tests for new features** - add to `tests/` when adding functionality
- **No secrets in code** - use `SecureConfigManager` for anything sensitive
- **Format before push** - `cargo fmt` and `cd frontend && npx prettier --write src/`
